## 🔋 [HARDWARE TIPS]

* **♨️ Heat:** AI processing generates significant heat. Always remove phone cases and ensure the device is in a well-ventilated area.
* **🔌 Battery:**
* - To prevent battery "swelling" from being at 100% charge indefinitely, use a Smart Plug. Set a timer to charge the device for 1 hour every 4-5 hours.
  - Dim your device's screen to reduce battery usage.
* **⚙️ Hardware Bypass (Expert Only):** For permanent 24/7 setups, consider removing the internal lithium battery entirely and powering the device directly via a 5V charging plug soldered to the battery terminals to eliminate fire risks.
